## 🎃 Getting Started

> Just heard, cool kids using pnpm 👦, so let's try it out in this project. Hope it works well. 🤞

`formhub-be` is backend setting, all pnpm setting and docker setting are in Package.json, scripts section.

### 🚀 How to run

For now, start backend

```bash
pnpm rebuild:be
```

### 📝 Working Notes

1. If you want to check my backend working notes, see [**HERE**](https://github.com/yanliu1111/docker-types-node-postgres-app), data model changed and schema.prisma changed, but the basic idea is the same, need to rebuild prisma client after schema changed, and rebuild backend service.
2. **Apollo** Server is used for GraphQL server
   Check doc `appolo-server-express` [**HERE**](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/migration/#migrate-from-apollo-server-express)
